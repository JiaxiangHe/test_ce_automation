# Code Exchange Repo Template
This repository is a template to be used when creating a new repository containing sample code, a sample application, or some other software related to Cisco technologies and to be made available for use by the Cisco DevNet community through [Code Exchange](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/) and/or [Automation Exchange](https://developer.cisco.com/automation-exchange/).

## Instructions

You have two options, if you have familiarity with Python, use the cookiecutter steps. Otherwise you can manually create a copy of this repo template. 


### Cookiecutter Automated Repo Creation

This process uses [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) to auto-generate the files for you. This is helpful if you create multiple use cases. 

> Note: This template assumes the BSD 3-Clause License, you can change it be other licenses afterwards if that is not what you want.


1. Issue this command `pip install cookiecutter` to get ready to use the template.
2. Use this command and answer the questions: `cookiecutter https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/code-exchange-repo-template`
3. Update the [README](./README.md), replacing the contents below as described in text within each section of the README. Feel free to combine or omit sections where appropriate. 
4. Update the [LICENSE](./LICENSE), replacing the file with the license selected for your code. See the [*Licensing info*](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/code-exchange-repo-template/tree/master/manual-sample-repo#licensing-info) section of this README for more info. 
5. Delete these instructions and everything up to the _Project Title_ from the README.
6. Write some great software and [submit](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/submit) it to Code Exchange and/or Automation Exchange.



#### Example 
```bash
use-cases$ cookiecutter https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/code-exchange-repo-template
project_name [my-awesome-devnet-code-exchange-project]: my-first-project
project_description [baseline DevNet Code Exchange Project]: New Things to come!
author_name [Your Name Here]: User Name
author_email [youremail@domain.com]: user@cisco.com
use-cases$ tree

### Manual Repo Creation

If you are only creating one use case, this process is probably easier. 

1. Create a new repository.
2. Copy all the files inside `manual-sample-repo` into your new repository. 
3. Update the [README](./README.md), replacing the contents below as described in text within each section of the README. Feel free to combine or omit sections where appropriate. 
4. Update the [LICENSE](./LICENSE), replacing the file with the license selected for your code. See the [*Licensing info*](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/code-exchange-repo-template/tree/master/manual-sample-repo#licensing-info) section of this README for more info. 
5. Delete these instructions and everything up to the _Project Title_ from the README.
6. Write some great software and [submit](https://developer.cisco.com/codeexchange/github/submit) it to Code Exchange and/or Automation Exchange.


## Automated Use Case
Remote observance is especially useful for offices, for example, and remote observance is in demand due to the fact that we are transitioning towards a hybrid work experience. Moreover, in our use case, there is a bee hive located at the office. For safety reasons, bee hive inspections have to be done with two or more people. In the unlikely event of an accident, the second person can provide assistance or call the emergency services. However, since fewer people are attending the office, it is sometimes inconvenient to have two people doing the inspection. Therefore, we have created a process and integation that allows us to conduct remote observance, where one team member can do the bee hive inspection alone, while team members observe the site remotely and can contact assistance if needed.

In addition to remote observance, the team would also like to monitor the honey bee colony. For this PoV, we have installed three Meraki MV cameras and a BEEP base, which encompasses multiple sensors to monitor a bee hive colony. We have created a bot that would interact during the remote observance process, but we have added features that allows the users to generate snapshots from the Meraki cameras or query the latest metric, e.g. temperature, humidity, weight, etc.
